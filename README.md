## Other Contributions
### Signal visualiser
We developed a signal visualizer GUI to support data exploration and preprocessing. You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/)
### SSVEP Simulator
We developed and hosted a real-time SSVEP simulator that can be configured and used for further real-time testing. It is available [here](https://gilded-kitsune-dfc3ec.netlify.app/)
