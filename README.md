# EEG-SSVEP-and-MI-Classifier
![Cover Image](images/cover.jpg)

This repository contains the official submission of the **MindCloud** team for the **MTC-AIC 3** competition. It includes all the source code, documentation, and model checkpoints for our EEG signal classifier designed for both SSVEP and MI tasks.

## Installation

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:AbdelrahmanAmgad201/EEG-SSVEP-and-MI-Classifier.git
cd EEG-SSVEP-and-MI-Classifier
```

## Other Contributions
### Signal visualiser
We developed a signal visualizer GUI to support data exploration and preprocessing. You can find it [here](https://github.com/AmirKaseb/EEG-GUI)
### SSVEP Simulator
We developed and hosted a real-time SSVEP simulator that can be configured and used for further real-time testing. It is available [here](https://gilded-kitsune-dfc3ec.netlify.app/)
## Future Plans
We have been exploring the possibility of acquiring a EEG signal headset to facilitate real-time testing and improving model accuracy and robustness to reach industry level performance.
