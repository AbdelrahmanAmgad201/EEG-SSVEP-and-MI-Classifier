## Other Contributions
### Signal visualiser
We developed a signal visualizer GUI to help us with data exploration and preprocessing which can be found ![here](https://www.youtube.com/)
### SSVEP Simulator
We developed and hosted a real-time SSVEP simulator which can be configurated and used to further test realtime ![here](https://gilded-kitsune-dfc3ec.netlify.app/)
